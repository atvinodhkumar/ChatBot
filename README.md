The aim is to develop an interactive Chat Bot using Python 3.6 to collect information about trucks, their specification and number in particular fleet from the user and store them in a CSV file.

## Prerequisites

The following are the required to get the code up and running.

* Make sure your Python version 3.6 or above.
* Make sure all the text files are stored in one folder.
